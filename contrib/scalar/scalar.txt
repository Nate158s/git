NAME
----
scalar - an opinionated repository management tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
scalar register [<enlistment>]
scalar unregister [<enlistment>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Scalar is an opinionated repository management tool. By creating new
repositories or registering existing repositories with Scalar, your Git
experience will speed up. Scalar sets advanced Git config settings,
maintains your repositories in the background, and helps reduce data sent
across the network.

An important Scalar concept is the enlistment: this is the top-level directory
of the project. It contains the subdirectory `src/` which is a Git worktree.
This encourages the separation between tracked files (inside `src/`) and
untracked files, such as build artifacts (outside `src/`).

The command implements various subcommands, and different options depending
on the subcommand.

COMMANDS
--------

Register
~~~~~~~~

register [<enlistment>]::
    Adds the enlistment's repository to the list of registered repositories
    and starts background maintenance. If `<enlistment>` is not provided,
    then the enlistment associated with the current working directory is
    registered.

Unregister
~~~~~~~~~~

unregister [<enlistment>]::
    Remove the specified repository from the list of repositories
    registered with Scalar and stop the scheduled background maintenance.
